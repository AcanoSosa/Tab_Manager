## Tab Manager
<p>A chrome extension tab saver with a twist.</p>

### The challenge
<p>This is a project I have been thinking about for months! :rocket:</p>
<p>I'm getting inspired by my favorite tab grouping chrome extension and trying to do my own version of it with extra functionality I wish it had. I'm looking forward to making it fully functional using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

#### The first goals of this project is to:
- Make a solution for the storing.
- Create the visual elements in the popover.
- Consume the information of the Json and present it in the UI.
- Create the accordion animation.

#### Next steps:
- Save current viewing tab in a tab group.
- Gather all opened tabs in a window
- Create UI for create new group with all opened tabs in a window
- Save the selected tabs in a new tab group.
