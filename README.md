## Tab Manager
A chrome extension tab saver with a twist.

####The challenge
This is a project I have been thinking about for months! :tw-1f680:
I'm getting inspired by my favorite tab grouping chrome extension and trying to do my own version of it with extra functionality I wish it had. I'm looking forward to making it fully functional using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#####The first goals of this project is to:
- ~~Make a solution for the storing.~~
- ~~Create the visual elements in the popover.~~
- ~~Consume the information of the Json and present it in the UI.~~
- Create the accordion animation.

#####Next steps:
- Save current viewing tab in a tab group.
- Gather all opened tabs in a window
- Create UI for create new group with all opened tabs in a window
- Save the selected tabs in a new tab group.
